**PyCity Schools Analysis**
This project analyzes the performance of schools within a fictional district using data processing and visualization techniques in Python. The analysis focuses on various metrics, including school type, budget, student scores in math and reading, and overall passing rates. The goal is to identify trends and draw insights about the factors influencing school performance.

**Repository Structure**
This analysis is part of the pandas-challenge Git repository. Within this repository, the analysis files can be found in the PyCitySchools folder. The folder contains the following key files:

**PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the full analysis, including data cleaning, calculations, and visualizations.
**PyCitySchools_starter.py:** This Python script can be run as a standalone script to perform the same analysis without using a Jupyter environment.
**PyCity_Schools_Analysis.docx:** This is a written report that summarizes the analysis, and draws two conclusions from the calculations.
Supporting Resources: Additional data files required for the analysis are also included in this folder.
